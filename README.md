In this tutorial, we will learn a clean and simple way to implement Razor Page CRUD in ASP.NET Core with jQuery AJAX and Bootstrap Modal. The ultimate aim is to build an Entity Management Set of Operations (CRUD) that doesn’t reload pages. We will be achieving this with the help of ASP.NET Core Razor Page, Razor Partial View, JQuery AJAX calls so that you would never have to see your page reload again but everything would just work flawlessly.
